# CLWebDev1FinalSept22
Final project for Code Louisville session.

The website idea is to create a model similar to Craigslist and AirBnB. That is a rental/trading platform that is catered to musical instruments. 

Basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is employed, and is entirely front-end as of now. Here are several aspects of web design utilized:
- Responsiveness based on screen size/device.
- Option of light or dark mode for user preference.
- Gallery of instruments to look at and sort based on instrument type.
